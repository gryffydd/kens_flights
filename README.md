| COMM history                 | This NSW DMR, Discovery 2000, AREA P, NARRABRI, NSW 2000 (P753), magnetic line data, AWAGS levelled is an airborne-derived magnetic line dataset for the NSW DMR, Discovery 2000, AREA P, NARRABRI, NSW 2000 survey. The data was acquired under the project No. 753 for the geological survey of NSW. A total of 43190 line-kilometres of data at a line spacing of 400m and 80m terrain clearance were acquired during this survey. To constrain long wavelengths in the data, an independent data set, the Australia-wide Airborne Geophysical Survey (AWAGS) airborne magnetic data, was used to control the base levels of the survey data (Milligan et al., 2009). This survey data is essentially levelled to AWAGS. Details of the specifications of individual airborne surveys can be found in the Fourteenth Edition of the Index of Airborne Geophysical Surveys (Percival, 2014). This Index is also available online at http://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset/79134.  References: Milligan, P.R., Minty, B.R.S., Richardson, M. & Franklin, R., 2009.

| COMM summary                 | Total magnetic intensity (TMI) data measures variations in the intensity of the Earth's magnetic field caused by the contrasting content of rock-forming minerals in the Earth crust. Magnetic anomalies can be either positive (field stronger than normal) or negative (field weaker) depending on the susceptibility of the rock. The data are processed via standard methods to ensure the response recorded is that due only to the rocks in the ground. The results produce datasets that can be interpreted to reveal the geological structure of the sub-surface. The processed data is checked for quality by GA geophysicists to ensure that the final data released by GA are fit-for-purpose.  These line dataset from the NSW DMR, Discovery 2000, AREA P, NARRABRI, NSW 2000 survey were acquired in 2000 by the NSW Government, and consisted of 43190 line-kilometres of data at 400m line spacing and 80m terrain clearance. To constrain long wavelengths in the data, an independent data set, the Australia-wide Airborne Geophysical Survey (AWAGS) airborne magnetic data, was used to control the base levels of the survey data. This survey data is essentially levelled to AWAGS. |
